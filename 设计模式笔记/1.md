### Symptoms of Rotting Design(设计腐烂)(Poor Design)(设计不良)

* Rigidity(僵化)

  - Tendency for software to be difficult to change, even in simple way.
  - Every change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent module. 
    (软件往往难以更改，即使是简单的更改.每次更改都会导致依赖模块的一系列后续更改)
  
* Fragility(脆弱性)
  
  - Tendency of the software to break in many places every time it is changed.
  - Often the breakage occurs in areas that have no conceptual relationship with the
  area that was changed.
  - Such software is impossible to maintain.(每次更改软件时，都会在许多地方出现故障.经常出现在与被更改区域没有概念关系的地方.的地方.这样的软件根本无法维护.)
  
* Immobility(无法移动性)
  
  - Inability to reuse software from other projects or from parts of the same project.
  
* Viscosity - Viscosity of the design(粘度 - 设计的粘度)
  
  - When faced with a change
  
    - some of the ways preserve the design
    - others, doe not (e.g., that’s hack.)
  - When the design preserving methods are harder to employ than the hacks, then the viscosity of the design is high
  - Changes or additions are easier to implement by doing the wrong thing
  
* Needless Complexity(不必要的复杂性)

  - Design contains elements that are not currently useful
    
    - Too much anticipation of future needs
    - Agile principles state that you should never anticipate future needs
  
  - Extra complexity is needed only when designing an application framework or customizable component(只有在设计应用程序框架或可定制组件时，才需要额外的复杂性。可定制组件)
  
* Needless Repetition(不必要的重复)

  - The same code appears over and over again, in slightly different forms
  
    - developers are missing an abstraction
    - bugs found in a repeating unit have to be fixed in every repetition
  
* Principles of Object-Oriented Class Design(面向对象设计原则)

  - Five Principles to Avoid the Symptoms of Rotting Design(避免腐烂设计的五个原则)
    
    - The Single-Responsibility Principle(SRP)(单一责任原则)
    - The Open Close Principle(OCP)(开闭原则)
    - The Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)(里氏代换原则)
    - The Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)(依赖倒换原则)
    - The Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)(接口隔离原则)
