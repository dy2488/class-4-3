### Symptoms of Rotting Design(设计腐烂)(Poor Design)(设计不良)

* Rigidity(僵化)

  - Tendency for software to be difficult to change, even in simple way.
  - Every change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent module. 
    (软件往往难以更改，即使是简单的更改.每次更改都会导致依赖模块的一系列后续更改)
  
* Fragility(脆弱性)
  
  - Tendency of the software to break in many places every time it is changed.
  - Often the breakage occurs in areas that have no conceptual relationship with the
  area that was changed.
  - Such software is impossible to maintain.(每次更改软件时，都会在许多地方出现故障.经常出现在与被更改区域没有概念关系的地方.的地方.这样的软件根本无法维护.)
  
* Immobility
  
  - Inability to reuse software from other projects or from parts of the same project.
  
* Viscosity - Viscosity of the design(粘度 - 设计的粘度)
  
  - When faced with a change
  
    - some of the ways preserve the design
    - others, doe not (e.g., that’s hack.)
  - When the design preserving methods are harder to employ than the hacks, then the viscosity of the design is high
  - Changes or additions are easier to implement by doing the wrong thing
  
* Needless Complexity(不必要的复杂性)

  - Design contains elements that are not currently useful
    
    - Too much anticipation of future needs
